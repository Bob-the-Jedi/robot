# Robotics 2019-2020 Repository

### Hey Guys!
Long story short, anything you do that relates to the robot needs to eventually end up in here to make it easy to collaborate. There's  some cool bits and bobs I've put in here that I'll get to in a minute.

### Who's Doing What?

* Luke Amos (C'est moi)

**Eco Disaster (Barrel Sorting One)**
* Aidan Healy

**Escape Route (Blind Maze One)**

**Minesweeper (Light Up Squares One)**

**Pi Noon (Awesome Balloon One)**

**Zombie Apocalypse (Nerf Death One)**
* Freddie Askem

**Temple Of Doom (Obstacle Course One)**

**API Team**
* Freddie Askem
* Luke Amos 

**Bloggers/Coders**
* Elisabeth Franks
* Laura Hollister

### General Stuff to Know
---
This is for everyone (that's you!). 
1. If you don't know how GitHub works, it's fairly intuitive but Google has many wonderful how-to guides.
2. Please try and keep everything as tidy as possible and try to name files and folders something kinda useful.
3. In the root of this repo there's a parts list document. Any time you guys realise you need a certain part buying, add to the doc and we'll relay it to big man Cullen.
4. Try and come to every meeting from now on because we'll be talking about how far we've got in our groups.
5. There is a Discord which hardly anyone is using at the mo. If you want to start a 4-bit voice channel and irritate everyone involved, Discord has you covered.
6. I'm not gonna put a doc of what everyone's roles are (ie designer/mechanic) because that's effort. Instead I'm gonna trust you to know which role you'd like to do. If there's an excess of people in any one role, THEN we can have a chat about stuff.
7. Please 'Watch' this repo just to make it easy for you all to find it again. You don't actually have to watch the repo on your screen 24/7, the computer will do that for you. Isn't technology marvellous.
 <br />

### Programmers
---
You guys are important. Without you the robot would not do anything except sit there and look fabulous. 

1. Pop your code in the appropriate folder within the **challenges** folder (depending on what challenge you're working on).
2. PLEASE try and comment as much as possible so other people know wassup.
3. We want you guys to write in pseudocode for the moment because we're working on an API that we'll use to tie everything together. I knew psueocode would be useful eventually :).
4. Don't forget to put the right extension in the name of the file (i.e python files are .py, arduino files are .ino)

#### API
We're making our own API because evidently we're very bored and nerdy so why not. If you're involved in this, please put API-related code into the **api** folder.

 <br />
 
### Designers
---
If you care about how the robot looks, you are officially a designer! Congratulations, your Great Aunt's hairdresser's gerbil is extremely proud.

1. If you guys draw up any sketches or blueprints or whatever, pop them in here.
2. You guys can make sub-folders but your main folder where all design stuff goes is the **general-design** folder.
3. If you decide to scrap a design, please remove any photos/docs relating to the dead design because otherwise mere mortals like myself will get confused.
 <br />

### Mechanics
---
You guys are all about how the different wires plug in. If a sparky bit electrocutes someone on the day, you are to blame. No pressure!!!

1. When you're shopping for parts make total sure the specs are up to scratch (ie if we need a battery make sure it gives us enough power and lasts more than a gnat's lifespan).
2. Same as with designers, if you guys have diagrams or whatever pop them in here but *pleaseeee* remember to delete old/rejected diagrams.
3. You guys can make sub-folders but your main folder where all mechanicy stuff goes is in the **general-mechanicy-bits** folder.
