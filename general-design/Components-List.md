#HEY INIGO!
Your sexy friend has made this document so you know exactly what sorta shit goes on the board mkay?

### Note
These sizes are not exact, they're just what google spits out (so reasonably exact). For the Pi and the Arduino they'll need cases anyways so sizes will be different. Also, we don't have all the stuff we need so yeah may cause issues. FUN!
