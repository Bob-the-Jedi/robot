# Challenges code

### Keeping everything running smoothly
It's gonna be hard to get everything working together with everyone programming at the same time. I've thought of a few things which should help keep the code readable for everyone

### Linting

Linting checks code and provides information on possible problems. This catches any common mistakes to make the code more reliable. We are going to use pylint; most editors should provide pylint integration (just google how to setup pylint with {editor})

### Tabs or spaces?

Spaces (4 of them)

### Code ownership

With a shared project, everyone can change all the code so expect other people to tweak your things. That being said - don't be rude and rewrite someone else's code completely without telling them you want to

### It doesn't have to be perfect

Don't worry if what you've written doesn't work perfectly, still push it and just a `# TODO` or `# FIXME` comment detailing the bits that don't work so other people know what to expect.
